kegerface
=========

A Kegerator Interface!
This project is for a port over to AngularJS running on Node.js for a Raspberry Pi implementation. It's a fork of the original Kegerface implementation meant as both a learning platform, and to give Kegerface more user friendly functionality.

Note for beers.csv
------------------------
If you have a long beer name, change the final value from "BeerName" to "BeerNameL" and it will format correctly for 2 lines.
